# PostgreSQL HA Cluster Manifest - REFERENCE ONLY
# 
# NOTE: This file is NOT used during automated deployment.
# The PostgreSQL cluster is automatically created by:
#   scripts/05-deploy-postgresql-cluster.sh
#
# This reference file shows the cluster configuration structure with:
# - Modern plugin-based backup (Barman Cloud Plugin)
# - Manual PodMonitor (no deprecated enablePodMonitor)
# - PgBouncer connection pooler
# - Pod anti-affinity for HA
#
# For actual deployment, the configuration is dynamically generated
# from environment variables in config/environment-variables.sh
#
# See scripts/05-deploy-postgresql-cluster.sh for the complete implementation.
